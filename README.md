**Instructions**:
* Choose a font on google fonts and import using the HTML link tag. Select different font weights e.g. light, regular, bold. Apply the font to all the elements on the page. 
* Create a stylesheet and work from there. 
* Underline the h1 heading. 
* Give all list items a light font weight.
* Give all headings with the class of `heading` a shadow and, in CSS, make all these elements appear uppercase. 
* Give the element with the class of `note` a bold font weight. Make the text appear italic. 
* Strike through all the elements with the class `todo-item`.
