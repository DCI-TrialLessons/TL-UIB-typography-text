**Instructions**:
* Choose a font on google fonts and import using the HTML link tag. Select different font weights e.g. light, regular, bold. Apply the font to all the elements on the page. 
* Create a stylesheet and work from there. 
* Underline the h1 heading. 
* Give all list items a light font weight.
* Give all headings with the class of `heading` a shadow and, in CSS, make all these elements appear uppercase. 
* Give the element with the class of `note` a bold font weight. Make the text appear italic. 
* Strike through all the elements with the class `todo-item`.

### Debugging your code
> [reading the test outputs](https://github.com/DCI-EdTech/autograding-setup/wiki/Reading-test-outputs)

There are two ways to see why tasks might not be completed:
#### 1. Running tests locally
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test` in the terminal. You will see where your solution differs from the expected result.

#### 2. Inspecting the test output on GitHub
- Go to the [Actions tab of your exercise repo](https://github.com/DigitalCareerInstitute/UIB-typography-text/actions)
- You will see a list of the test runs. Click on the topmost one.
- Click on 'Autograding'
- Expand the item 'Run DCI-EdTech/autograding-action@main'
